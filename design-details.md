# Design details

## Why Node.js?

Apart from Node I had option of using Django and PHP, so I selected this Framework because: 

1. Its asynchronous and stateless platform that can handle multiple request easily with better performance and reliability. 
2. A better community support.
3. Wanted to learn new language and enhance my skills.

## Why low db?

I favored this type of database because :

1. It has high promise for CRUD operation on Database. 
2. Better than SQLite because our app doesn't require lot on transnational requests.
3. Equally good with CoucheDB, and less complex than MongoDB .
